# Hoshi
Hoshi was developed with the objective of creating a platform that assists users in finding anime and manga that suits their preference. The platform aims to address the challenges faced by novice fans who struggle with navigating the vast amount of content available. These users often have trouble finding credible information sources and recommendations from individuals with similar interests. Hoshi seeks to solve these issues and make discovering anime and manga a more enjoyable experience for all users.
<br><br>

## Features
- Extensive Library: Hoshi offers a massive collection of anime and manga for fans to discover and explore.
- Unbiased Recommendations: Hoshi's recommendation system is powered by a popular LLM known as SBERT (Sentence Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The system leverages the media synopsis to find similar media, providing unbiased and neutral recommendations, making it ideal for users who want to discover new titles without being influenced by other people's viewing tastes, preferences, or ratings.
- Advanced Filtering: Users can filter their search by format, status and hundreds of genres and tags making it easy to find a media that match their preference.
- Detailed Information: Hoshi provides comprehensive information about each piece of media, including related media, characters, episodes, trailers, and statistics, to help users find what to watch or read next.
- Simple Interface: Hoshi's intuitive and simple UI makes it easy for users to navigate and explore the platform.
- Access on the Go: Hoshi is a web application, thus it can be accessed on any device that has a browser installed.
